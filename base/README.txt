When you run the py script, it will ask for a starting state and search method

This should be entered in the form "####X", where #### is the 4-digit ID of the
start state, and X is the letter associated with the search method. 

All input and output is in the console. Once an output is provided, it will
prompt you for another input. If you are finished testing, you can enter q to
exit.
